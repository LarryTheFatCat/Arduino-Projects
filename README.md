# Arduino-Projects
Projects completed in my computer engineering course using Arduino Uno

Teacher took down labs 1 - 6 due to the unit test being based on them and having to write out the code on paper, can't find it on my old laptop nor new one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Run code via Tinkercad or Arduino IDE, will (probably) not work on VSCode b/c specific libraries need to be installed but are preinstalled on Arduino IDE. 

These aren't serious projects, rather the growth and development of me doing Arduino projects and learning about hardware components and coding on microcontrollers.
